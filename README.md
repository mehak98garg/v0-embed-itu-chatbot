# v0-embed-zerowidth-agent

This repository contains a simple React component that acts as a chat agent. It communicates with a serverless function that proxies requests to the zerowidth API. The project is designed to be deployed on Vercel and easily embedded in a website (for example, in a Google Site via an iframe).

## Features

- **React Component:** A basic user interface for entering messages and displaying responses.
- **Serverless Proxy:** A serverless function that forwards requests to the zerowidth API.
- **Environment Variables:** Secret keys and API endpoints are stored in an .env file.
- **Basic CORS Support:** Enables cross-origin requests.
- **Error Handling:** Handles API errors gracefully.
- **Verbose Comments:** Explanations throughout the code to help beginners.
- **MIT License:** Open-source and free to use (see License section).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your computer.
- A Vercel account for deployment.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for development.

### Setup in VS Code

1. **Create a New GitHub Repository:**  
   Log in to GitHub, create a new repository named "v0-embed-zerowidth-agent" without initializing with a README.

2. **Clone the Repository in VS Code:**  
   Open VS Code, use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and select "Git: Clone".  
   Enter your repository URL and choose a local folder.  
   Open the cloned folder in VS Code.

3. **Add Project Files:**  
   Create the following files and folders in VS Code as per the structure above:

   - pages/index.js (React component)
   - pages/api/proxy.js (serverless function)
   - package.json (project configuration)
   - .env.example (environment variables template)
   - README.md (this file)
   - LICENSE (MIT License file)

4. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and run "npm install".

5. **Set Up Environment Variables:**  
   Copy .env.example to a new file named ".env" in the project root and update the variables:

   - ZEROWIDTH_API_URL should be set.
   - BEARER_TOKEN should be set.

6. **Run the Development Server:**  
   In the terminal, run "npm run dev" and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to preview the chat component.

## Deployment on Vercel

1. **Push Your Code to GitHub:**  
   Stage, commit, and push your changes using VS Code's Source Control tools or the terminal.

2. **Import Your Repository into Vercel:**  
   Log in to Vercel at vercel.com and create a new project by importing your "v0-embed-zerowidth-agent" repository from GitHub.  
   Vercel should auto-detect your Next.js configuration.

3. **Configure Environment Variables on Vercel:**  
   In the Vercel project settings, add the following variables:

   - ZEROWIDTH_API_URL:  <the specific flow you want to access>
   - BEARER_TOKEN:  <from the zerowidth api for your flow>

4. **Deploy the Project:**  
   Click "Deploy" in the Vercel dashboard. Monitor the build logs to ensure the project builds successfully.  
   Once deployed, Vercel will provide a URL for your project.

## Embedding in a Google Site

1. Copy the deployment URL from Vercel.
2. On your Google Site, add an HTML embed or use the embed widget.
3. Insert an iframe snippet similar to the following (replace the src URL with your Vercel deployment URL):

<iframe src="https://your-vercel-deployment-url.vercel.app" width="600" height="400"></iframe>

4. Save and publish your Google Site to see the embedded chat component.

## Additional Information

- **Local Development:**  
  Use "npm run dev" to start the development server. Any changes saved in VS Code will trigger a hot-reload.
- **VS Code Tips:**  
  Leverage the integrated Git, terminal, and debugging tools in VS Code to enhance your workflow.
- **Documentation:**  
  For further details on Vercel and Next.js, refer to their official documentation on vercel.com/docs and nextjs.org/docs.
